## Notes
- INV-CORE-SCHEMA completed: Added stockCounts, stockCountItems, inventoryCostLayers, inventoryForecasts, inventoryAlerts tables
- Added warehouse management enums to enums.ts
- Updated Zod validation schemas in src/lib/schemas/inventory.ts
- INV-CORE-API completed: Created comprehensive server functions in 6 files:
  - src/server/functions/inventory.ts - Core CRUD, adjustments, allocation, receiving, dashboard
  - src/server/functions/locations.ts - Simple locations and warehouse hierarchy management
  - src/server/functions/stock-counts.ts - Cycle counting lifecycle (create, start, count, complete)
  - src/server/functions/valuation.ts - FIFO cost layers, valuation reports, aging, turnover
  - src/server/functions/forecasting.ts - Demand forecasts, safety stock, reorder recommendations
  - src/server/functions/alerts.ts - Alert CRUD, triggering, acknowledgment
- TS2345 errors in server functions are TanStack Start framework inference quirks (consistent with existing codebase)
- Pre-existing typecheck errors in customers/pipeline components (not related to inventory changes)
