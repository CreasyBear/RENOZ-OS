# Worktrees Directory

This directory contains isolated git worktrees for parallel feature development.

## Active Worktrees

Track your active work here:

| Worktree | Branch | Status | Claude Session |
|----------|--------|--------|----------------|
| (none currently) | - | - | - |

## Commands

```bash
# Create new worktree
bash ~/.claude/plugins/cache/every-marketplace/compound-engineering/*/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh create feature-name

# List worktrees
bash ~/.claude/plugins/cache/every-marketplace/compound-engineering/*/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh list

# Cleanup merged
bash ~/.claude/plugins/cache/every-marketplace/compound-engineering/*/skills/git-worktree/scripts/worktree-manager.sh cleanup
```

## Rules

1. One feature = one worktree
2. Never stash - always commit WIP
3. Update this file when starting/finishing work
4. Merge to master only when feature is complete
