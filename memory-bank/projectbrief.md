# Project Brief

Renoz v3 is a multi-tenant CRM for renovation/construction businesses built with TanStack Start, Drizzle ORM, and Supabase. The system emphasizes domain-driven organization, strict schema/validation alignment, and production-ready UI/UX.

## Goals

- Standardize domains with consistent patterns across schema, validation, server functions, hooks, and UI.
- Maintain production-quality UX using shadcn/ui + Tailwind with TanStack Query.

## Scope
- Full-stack implementation across routes, components, server functions, schemas, and background jobs.
- Domain standardization as defined in `STANDARDS.md`.

## Non-Goals
- Experimental or minimal implementations for core workflows.
